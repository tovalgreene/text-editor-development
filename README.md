# J.A.T.E. - Just Another Text Editor

J.A.T.E. is a progressive web application (PWA) that provides a simple, clean platform for writing notes or code snippets with seamless offline capabilities.

## Description

J.A.T.E., short for Just Another Text Editor, is a full-stack application that runs in the browser and functions offline. It's built to allow developers to create notes or code snippets on-the-go, without the need for an internet connection. Once back online, the content can be reliably retrieved for later use. It uses IndexedDB for client-side storage and integrates with a service worker for offline functionality and asset caching.
